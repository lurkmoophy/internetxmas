                    <h2>The Internet Xmas Party Code of Conduct</h2>
                    <p>All attendees, sponsors and volunteers at our event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>
                    <p><em>tl;dr: Be excellent with each other.</em></p>
                    <h3>Need Help?</h3>
                    <p>Get in touch with either of us, the organisers, at <a href="mailto:charlotte@theinternetxmas.com">charlotte@theinternetxmas.com</a> or <a href="mailto:charlotte@theinternetxmas.com">luke@theinternetxmas.com</a>. Charlotte and Luke will make themselves known to all attendees at the beginning of the night, but if you can’t find them, talk to whoever is manning the door, who will point you towards one of the organisers.</p>
                    <h3>The Quick Version</h3>
                    <p>This party is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for our party, including the party itself, Twitter and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the party without a refund at the discretion of the organisers.</p>
                    <h3>The Less Quick Version</h3>
                    <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
                    <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
                    <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.</p> 
                    <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the party with no refund.</p>
                    <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of staff immediately. Charlotte and Luke will make themselves known to all attendees at the beginning of the night, but if you can’t find them, talk to whoever is manning the door.</p>
                    <p>Staff will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the party. We value your attendance.</p>
